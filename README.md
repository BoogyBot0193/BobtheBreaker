## **Uniqueness & Design Philosophy**

> [!TIP]  
> The gameâ€™s core philosophy is to push the boundaries of 2.5D design by fusing hand-crafted 2D animation with immersive 3D spaces, avoiding generic templates and focusing on originality in both art and gameplay.

- **Handcrafted Animations**: Every animation is produced in-house, reflecting countless hours of work.
    
- **Original Storytelling**: The narrative unfolds through bespoke cutscenes, not generic storyboards.
    
- **Visual Identity**: The blend of 2D and 3D creates a distinctive aesthetic rarely seen in beat-em-up games.
